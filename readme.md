# JARVIS

## An exploration in voice based assistance through the web.
With Viewport on your iPad and Android Tablet, you can present your portfolio at any time, showing process, revisions, and notes that led to the final solution. A compartmented presentation model, coupled with subtle design elements, puts your work front and center.

We know you spent time crafting and organizing your portfolio of work, and we believe that presenting physical work to a potential client or employer is an important part of the hiring process, but sometimes carrying around your portfolio just isn't feasible. With Viewport, if the topic of your work comes up, you can present your portfolio instantly, even if you're offline.

## Web based.
This exploration is web based built using a healthy dose of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript using the artyom.js library.


## Quickstart
Download and run the directory through a local web server. I use [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)  
Open the server address in Chrome and allow microphone access.

### Test Voice Commands.
By default this is set to "always listen" so no trigger word is required.

1) "Open Gmail" / "close Gmail"  
2) "Open the news" / "close the news"
