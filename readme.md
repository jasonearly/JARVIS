# JARVIS

## An exploration in voice based assistance through the web.


## Web based.
This exploration is web based built using a healthy dose of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript using the artyom.js library.


## Quickstart
Download and run the directory through a local web server. I use [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)  
Open the server address in Chrome and allow microphone access.

### Test Voice Commands.
By default this is set to "always listen" so no trigger word is required.

1) "Open Gmail" / "close Gmail"  
2) "Open the news" / "close the news"
